Welcome to Boozy version 2, an Apple watch app! üçπ

*Boozy is your best friend when you're out on a Saturday night! It accomplishes this by helping track the number of drinks you've had and recommending water based on those drinks via notifications. This helps you have a great time without regretting it the next day!*

*New features include:*
* A new BAC (blood alcohol percentage) indicator based on the drinks you have
* A new drink selector
* New design
